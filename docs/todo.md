# Notion AI Notepad - Project TODO

## Phase 1: Design System & Setup

- [x] Design system with hand-drawn sketch aesthetic (warm cream, charcoal lines, organic shapes)
- [x] Typography setup (bold marker-style headers, monospaced typewriter fonts)
- [x] Global styling and CSS variables for sketch aesthetic
- [x] Create reusable UI component library with sketch design

## Phase 2: Core Note-Taking Features

- [x] Rich text editor with markdown support
- [x] Hierarchical folder and page organization system
- [x] IndexedDB implementation for local browser storage
- [x] Client-side encryption for data security
- [x] Real-time auto-save functionality
- [x] Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations for notes

## Phase 3: Search & Organization

- [x] Full-text search across all notes
- [x] Tagging system for notes
- [x] Filter and organize notes by tags
- [x] Search result highlighting and navigation

## Phase 4: AI Capabilities

- [x] AI-powered content generation within notes
- [x] Auto-completion suggestions
- [x] Text summarization feature
- [x] Content expansion feature
- [x] Tone adjustment (formal, casual, friendly, etc.)
- [x] Grammar correction
- [x] Intelligent content suggestions based on context

## Phase 5: Voice & Transcription

- [x] Voice memo recording functionality
- [x] Automatic speech-to-text transcription
- [x] Timestamp markers for voice notes
- [x] Integration of transcribed text into notes

## Phase 6: Export & Cloud Backup

- [x] Export notes to Markdown format
- [x] Export notes to PDF format
- [x] Export notes to plain text format
- [x] Encrypted cloud backup to S3 storage
- [x] Cross-device sync capability
- [x] Disaster recovery mechanism

## Disaster Recovery

- [x] Say what a restore would do before it does any of it
- [x] Keep a newer local note rather than writing the archive over it
- [x] Date what a restore writes, so the next sync does not undo it
- [x] Carry version history and the bin in the archive, not just notes
- [x] Back up on a cadence rather than when somebody remembers
- [x] Prove a stored archive still decrypts, before it is needed
- [x] Say what a backup cannot hold, next to the restore button

## Phase 7: Testing & Optimization

- [x] Unit tests for core functionality
- [x] Integration tests for features

## Two Devices, One Server, A Real Database

- [x] Drive the real encryption, merge and storage together rather than plain objects
- [x] A pulled note arrives readable, with the other device's clock on it
- [x] A conflict writes both versions, and the losing copy lands in the same folder
- [x] A deletion whose tombstone is owed is not resurrected
- [x] A row this browser has no key for is left alone, and harms nothing beside it
- [x] Cover the order `runSync` applies a plan in, by calling it rather than mirroring it

## Deleting A Note While The Server Is Refusing

- [x] Drop the autosave's hold on a note that has been deleted
- [x] Prove a deletion whose tombstone is owed is not undone by the row still there
- [x] Prove it stays deleted across repeated syncs, not just the first
- [x] Wait for the sync the hook starts on mount, rather than racing it

## Testing the Wiring, Not Only the Decisions

- [x] A harness that can render a component and drive a hook
- [x] Cover the sync-to-editor refresh, end to end through the real hook
- [x] Cover the autosave guard on a note the sync installed
- [x] Cover a pending edit being written down before the pull
- [x] Stop merely opening a note re-dating it, and beating a newer edit
- [x] Performance optimization
- [ ] Browser compatibility testing
- [x] Security audit for encryption
- [ ] User experience testing

## Reading A Whole Workspace Without Freezing It

- [x] Measure where the time actually goes before changing anything
- [x] Decrypt a batch of notes together rather than one after another
- [x] Stop the base64 decode costing more than the cryptography it feeds
- [x] Guard both by asserting the shape, not by timing anything

## A Copy Button That Lied

- [x] Confirm real Firefox/Safari runs are blocked here — this sandbox's
      network policy refuses the Playwright browser download, so this is a
      static audit rather than a run
- [x] Find the places a browser API can fail in ways Chromium's default
      config does not surface
- [x] One helper, used everywhere a copy button exists, that says whether it
      actually worked instead of assuming
- [ ] `Browser compatibility testing` stays open — this closed one class of
      finding, not the item

## A Recording Labelled By Assumption, Not By What It Was

- [x] Same method as the copy button: find where this app assumes Chromium's
      behaviour is every browser's. `VoiceMemo.tsx` records with
      `new MediaRecorder(stream)` and no explicit type, then hardcodes the
      resulting Blob as `audio/webm` — true on Chrome and Firefox, false on
      Safari, which has no webm support and records `audio/mp4` instead
- [x] Read `mediaRecorder.mimeType` — the spec-defined, actual negotiated
      type — rather than assuming, for both the Blob label used for playback
      and transcription, and the extension a download is saved under
- [x] The server side was already ready for this: `getFileExtension` in
      `_core/voiceTranscription.ts` has mapped `audio/mp4` to `.m4a` all
      along. Only the client was sending the wrong label
- [x] Prove it: a fake `MediaRecorder` reporting `audio/mp4`, the way Safari's
      would, and assert the download extension and the mimeType sent to
      transcription both follow it rather than staying `.webm` — failing
      against the pre-fix code and passing against the fix
- [ ] `Browser compatibility testing` stays open — two classes closed now
      (clipboard, this one), not the item itself; nothing here rules out a
      third

## A Drag That Never Started, In One Browser Only

- [x] Same method again: `Sidebar.tsx`'s `handleNoteDragStart` and
      `handleFolderDragStart` set `dataTransfer.effectAllowed` and tracked
      the dragged item entirely through React state, but never called
      `dataTransfer.setData`. Chrome does not require that call to begin a
      drag; Firefox does, by spec, and refuses to start the drag at all
      without it — so every drop handler in this file would be unreachable
      there, silently, with nothing to see in a Chromium-only sandbox
- [x] Call `setData` in both — the value itself is never read back, since
      every drop handler already goes through `draggedItem` state, but the
      call has to happen for Firefox to let the drag begin in the first
      place
- [x] First test for this component: render the real `Sidebar`, fire a real
      `dragstart` with a fake `DataTransfer` (jsdom has none), and assert
      `setData` was called for both a note row and a folder row — failing
      against the pre-fix code and passing against the fix
- [ ] `Browser compatibility testing` stays open — three classes closed now
      (clipboard, voice memo mimeType, this one); still not a claim that a
      fourth does not exist

## A Help Dialog That Named The Wrong Key, On Its Own Platform

- [x] A fourth sweep for this sandbox's own sweep found nothing new, so the
      same method was turned on the platform axis instead of the browser
      one: where does this app assume one keyboard is everyone's, the way
      it was assuming one engine was. `lib/shortcuts.ts` already does this
      correctly everywhere — `matchesShortcut` reads `navigator.platform`
      to decide whether "Cmd" means Meta or Control, and `formatKeys`
      renders `⌘`/`Ctrl` to match — except `ShortcutsModal.tsx`'s own
      footer tip, which hardcoded the literal text `Cmd+?` instead of
      calling `formatKeys` like every shortcut row above it does
- [x] Fixed by looking up the `help` shortcut and formatting its keys, with
      the old literal string kept only as a fallback for the case where it
      is not found
- [x] First test for this component: render the real dialog on a stubbed
      `navigator.platform`, and check the footer's own `<kbd>` specifically
      — the shortcut list above it renders the same shortcut's keys too,
      in a plain `<div>`, so a bare text query would have matched both and
      proven nothing. Fails against the pre-fix code (`Cmd+?` on Windows),
      passes against the fix (`Ctrl+?`)

## Profiling The Real Browser Instead Of Guessing From The Code

- [x] Seed a 300-note workspace and take a real CPU profile of a cold reload
- [x] Take one of opening a note and typing in that same workspace
- [x] Check a hypothesis before shipping it — `shared/crdt.ts`'s `encodeUpdate`
      looked like the same base64 anti-pattern already fixed elsewhere;
      benchmarked instead of assumed, and it is already the faster of the two
      shapes at every size tried, so it was left alone
- [x] Conclude honestly: both profiles ran 78–86% idle, no function attributed
      over 2% of sampled time, and the largest single contributor during
      typing was React's own reconciler, not application code. There is
      nothing further to fix that this profiling found — not a claim that
      every scenario was tried, but the two most obvious ones (a cold load
      and typing) came back clean after the decrypt and base64 fixes above

## A Real Browser, At Least One

- [x] Run the actual build in a real engine, not jsdom — nothing else in this repo did
- [x] Prove content is ciphertext on disk in real IndexedDB, not just in a polyfill
- [x] Prove a note survives a real reload, through the real autosave debounce
- [ ] The same, in Firefox and Safari — left undone; only Chromium is installed here

## A Recording That Outlived Its Own Reference

- [x] Find the blob: URL that was created once per recording and never
      revoked — `exportService.ts` and `TwoFactorSettings.tsx` already
      revoke theirs, `VoiceMemo.tsx` never did
- [x] Revoke it wherever the recording is discarded: delete, a successful
      transcription, and unmount — not just where the state setter clears it
- [x] Fold `VoiceMemo`'s own hand-built download anchor into the existing
      `downloadBlob` helper, which appends to the document before clicking;
      the local copy didn't, the same no-op risk `TwoFactorSettings.tsx`
      already documents
- [x] Add the `@vitejs/plugin-react` `vitest.config.ts` was missing — no
      client test had rendered a component with real JSX before, so the gap
      was invisible until this one tried to
- [x] Prove it: `URL.revokeObjectURL` spied on through record → delete,
      record → transcribe, and unmount, each failing against the pre-fix
      component and passing against the fix
- [x] A follow-up review of that fix found two more real paths: a transcribe
      request still in flight after the recording it was transcribing was
      deleted and replaced unconditionally discarded the replacement, and
      unmounting mid-recording (before Stop was ever clicked) left the
      microphone and the one-second timer running with nothing to stop them
- [x] Verified live, not just in jsdom: the real component driven in real
      Chromium via a throwaway dev route, a genuine `MediaRecorder` recording
      fake-device audio, real `URL.createObjectURL`/`revokeObjectURL` spied
      on — create/revoke paired across delete, download and unmount, with no
      orphaned or double-revoked URLs across repeated cycles

## A Reconnect That Outlived The Disconnect That Should Have Stopped It

- [x] `collaborationClient.ts` already carries one fix for "leaving a shared
      note reconnects a second later anyway" — `closedByUs`, checked by the
      close handler before it schedules a reconnect. It only guards the
      synchronous case. A drop that happens moments before `disconnect()` is
      called has already scheduled a reconnect by then, and nothing told
      that pending timer to stop
- [x] `connect()` unconditionally clears `closedByUs` at its own first line
      — written for the legitimate case of a deliberate reconnect after a
      deliberate disconnect — so the stale timer firing later undoes the
      disconnect it was supposed to have no part of, and reopens a socket to
      a room the component has already unmounted out of, with a `doc` that
      may already be destroyed on the other end of its callbacks
- [x] Fixed by keeping the timer's own handle and cancelling it in
      `disconnect()`, the same shape `stopHeartbeat` already uses for its
      `setInterval`
- [x] Proved it: scheduled a reconnect with a close, then called
      `disconnect()` before the backoff elapsed, then advanced the clock a
      full minute — failing against the pre-fix code (a second socket opens
      anyway) and passing against the fix (none does)

## A Help Dialog That Listed Shortcuts Nothing Answered To

- [x] `ShortcutsModal` lists the entire Formatting category — Bold, Italic,
      Underline, Code, Heading 1/2/3, Bullet List, Numbered List, Quote —
      each with a correctly platform-formatted key combo next to it, as
      though pressing it did something. None of them did:
      `useKeyboardShortcuts`'s global handler only lets
      `help`/`command-palette`/`open-search` through while focus sits in an
      `<input>` or `<textarea>`, and `NotesApp.tsx` never registered the rest
      of the Formatting category as handlers regardless — so even focus
      outside the editor wouldn't have helped. The note body is a
      `<textarea>` (`RichTextEditor.tsx`), which is the one place a person
      is actually focused while they'd reach for Cmd+B
- [x] `RichTextEditor.tsx`'s toolbar already had the right action for each
      of these (`insertMarkdown`, wired to each button's `onClick`) — the gap
      was never in what to do, only in reaching it from the keyboard. Added
      a `formattingActions` map, keyed by the same shortcut ids
      `lib/shortcuts.ts` already defines, and pointed both the toolbar
      buttons and a new `onKeyDown` on the textarea at the same functions,
      so the two paths can't drift apart the way two independent copies of
      the same `insertMarkdown` call would
- [x] Heading 3 has no toolbar button — the toolbar only ever offered H1/H2
      — but `ShortcutsModal` still lists it like every other Formatting
      shortcut. Wired it into `formattingActions` anyway, keyboard-only,
      rather than leaving the one shortcut in the category that happens to
      have no button still doing nothing
- [x] The toolbar's own tooltip for Bold/Italic/Underline carried a
      hardcoded `"Ctrl+B"`-style literal that was never actually rendered
      (`title` read `btn.label`, not the dead `shortcut` field) — so it
      wasn't a live bug, but it was the same landmine `ShortcutsModal`'s
      footer tip already was: the day someone wires it up, it is wrong on a
      Mac. Replaced it with a lookup through `formatKeys`, now actually
      rendered, and extended it to every Formatting button rather than only
      the three that happened to have it
- [x] First test for this component: fires a real `keydown` with
      `ctrlKey`/`metaKey` set against a stubbed `navigator.platform`, and
      asserts `onChange` receives the same wrapped text clicking the
      toolbar button would have produced — covering both platforms, the
      keyboard-only Heading 3 case, and that a bare key with no modifier
      does nothing. Fails against the pre-fix code, which had no
      `onKeyDown` on the textarea at all

## A Help Dialog's Promise With Nothing Behind It At All

- [x] Same sweep, one category over: `lib/shortcuts.ts` has declared
      `command-palette` (Cmd+/) since the shortcut list existed,
      `ShortcutsModal` has always listed it with a correct platform-formatted
      key combo, and `useKeyboardShortcuts` even special-cases it to fire
      while typing in a note — the same treatment given to Help and Search.
      Unlike Bold or Italic, nothing was missing a wire: there was no feature
      on the other end of it anywhere in the codebase to wire to
- [x] Built `CommandPalette.tsx` — a small quick-actions dialog, filterable by
      typing, navigable with arrow keys, opened by the shortcut that already
      claimed to open it. Seven actions: New Note, New Folder, Search Notes,
      Version History, Share Note, Toggle Theme, Keyboard Shortcuts — each
      reusing the exact function `NotesApp.tsx` already had for its toolbar
      or its own (now real) keyboard shortcut, not a second copy of the same
      logic
- [x] `new-folder` and `toggle-theme` were two more Navigation/General
      shortcuts `ShortcutsModal` listed with nothing behind them, found while
      building the palette's own action list. Wired both as real global
      shortcuts too — not just reachable through the palette — since showing
      a key combo next to a palette row that does not work when pressed
      directly outside it would have been the same lie at a smaller scale
- [x] An action the palette cannot usefully run is left out of the list
      entirely, not shown disabled: Share Note and Version History need a
      note open, and hiding them is more honest than a greyed-out row inviting
      a click that would open a dialog with nothing in it
- [x] First test for this component: filtering, arrow-key navigation with
      wraparound, Enter running the selected command, click running the
      clicked one, the dialog resetting on reopen, and the shortcut hint
      reading `Ctrl+N`/`⌘N` by platform like everywhere else in the app
- [x] Verified live in real Chromium against the production build: opened
      the palette with Ctrl+/ from inside the note editor itself — the one
      case the fix is actually for — filtered down to "New Folder", ran it
      with Enter, and confirmed a folder actually landed in IndexedDB and the
      palette closed
- [x] `delete-note` (Cmd+Delete) was the one Editing-category shortcut left
      in the same advertised-but-unwired state after the palette's own two
      finds. Wired it to the same `removeNote` the sidebar's delete button
      already calls — soft-delete, so there is a Recently Deleted net under
      it the same as every other way of deleting a note
- [x] `undo`/`redo` (Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z) stay unwired, and deliberately:
      their state (`history`, `historyIndex`) lives private inside
      `RichTextEditor.tsx`, with no ref or prop exposing it, so reaching them
      from `NotesApp.tsx`'s global handler needs forwarding a ref across that
      boundary — a real refactor, not the one-line wire the others were. Left
      for its own change rather than done quietly inside this one
- [x] Verified live in real Chromium against the production build: opened a
      note, clicked outside any input, pressed Ctrl+Delete, and confirmed the
      note count in IndexedDB dropped by one and the editor closed — the
      exact shape `removeNote` already produces from the sidebar's own
      delete button

## Stopping the Stylesheet From Overruling the Call Site

- [x] Move `.btn-notion*`, `.input-notion` and `.editor-*` into `@layer components`
- [x] Make the button classes self-sufficient so they need no shadcn `Button` underneath
- [x] Render the 50 notion buttons as plain `<button>` elements
- [x] Add `.btn-notion-sm` and `.btn-notion-destructive` for the states the cva variants carried
- [x] Give `Input`, `Textarea` and `SelectTrigger` a `variant="notion"` instead of a class fight
- [x] Drop the two `!important` workarounds the trap had forced
- [x] Prove it inert by diffing computed styles in Chromium, light and dark
- [x] One rule the audit missed, found later: `.container` — both the base
      definition and its own 768px override — sat unlayered at the bottom of
      the file the whole time. Nothing currently writes `className="container"`
      anywhere, so it changed nothing visible; moved into `@layer components`
      alongside `.btn-notion`, consolidated with its responsive override, so
      the day something does use it, a call-site utility wins rather than
      losing silently. Confirmed in the built CSS that cascade layer order is
      `base < components < utilities`, so `@layer components` is correctly
      outranked by any Tailwind utility class, same as `.btn-notion` already is

## Never Losing the Other Side of an Edit

- [x] Record what this device and the server last agreed, per note
- [x] Detect a real conflict instead of picking a winner on the clock
- [x] Keep the losing version as a note of its own rather than overwriting it
- [x] Pull before flushing, so an owed push cannot erase the other version first
- [x] Record the baseline on direct pushes, so a pending push is not read as a conflict
- [x] Say when the server holds notes this browser has no key for
- [x] Key portability, so a second device can read its own notes at all
- [x] Refresh the open editor when a sync replaces the note being looked at

## The Note You Are Looking At

- [x] Persist the debounced edit locally before the pull, so the merge can see it
- [x] Refresh the open editor when the merge replaced its note
- [x] Close it when the merge deleted it, instead of autosaving it back
- [x] Keep what is being typed when the store is behind

## Carrying the Key to Another Device

- [x] Read the key bytes out without making the live key extractable
- [x] A checksummed phrase that catches every single-character typo and transposition
- [x] Re-encrypt this device's notes, deleted notes and versions onto an imported key
- [x] Leave untouched anything the old key cannot open — it is what the new key is for
- [x] Reveal, copy and download the phrase from the account panel
- [x] Say in the export manifest where the key is, now that there is somewhere
- [x] Encrypt version history at rest, so it can travel too

## Version History That Is Actually Encrypted

- [x] Encrypt the snapshot, and set `isEncrypted` from what was done to it
- [x] Fix restore, which threw on every encrypted note and did nothing
- [x] Read the plaintext rows already in people's browsers rather than dropping them
- [x] Refuse to restore a snapshot this browser cannot read, instead of writing base64 over the note
- [x] Decrypt the preview, so it is not a screen of base64
- [x] Carry version history onto an imported key with everything else

/**
 * `URL.createObjectURL` keeps its Blob alive until revoked, not until
 * garbage collected. `exportService.ts` and `TwoFactorSettings.tsx` both
 * revoke theirs immediately after one `<a>` click; this component's URL has
 * to survive for playback and download, so it has to be revoked wherever the
 * recording is discarded instead — on delete, on a successful transcription,
 * and on unmount. Before the fix it was created once per recording and never
 * revoked at all: `setAudioURL("")` drops the component's only reference to
 * it but leaves the browser holding the recording in memory regardless.
 *
 * These tests drive the real component, with `MediaRecorder` and
 * `getUserMedia` stubbed (jsdom has neither) and `URL.createObjectURL` /
 * `revokeObjectURL` spied on rather than mocked away, so a fix that revokes
 * the wrong URL or skips a path still fails these.
